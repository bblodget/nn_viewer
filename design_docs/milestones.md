# NNCircuit V2 Milestones

This document outlines key milestones for the NNCircuit V2 project. Each milestone represents a testable checkpoint with specific verification criteria to ensure progress is solid before moving forward.

## Milestone 1: Core Architecture (Completed)

**Objective**: Establish the foundational code structure with unified component model.

**Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ Project structure and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Unified component registry
- ‚úÖ Expression evaluation engine
- ‚úÖ JSON parsing and validation
- ‚úÖ Unified component class system

**Verification Steps**:
1. Load a simple component definition via registry
2. Verify parameter substitution works with expressions
3. Validate that a primitive can be instantiated
4. Validate that a module with nested components can be instantiated
5. Verify latency calculation for both primitives and modules

**Success Criteria**: Component definitions can be loaded, instantiated with parameters, and properly connected within a module. Latency calculations correctly determine timing across component hierarchies.

## Milestone 2: Rendering Foundations

**Objective**: Create the base rendering system that can display primitives and simple modules.

**Deliverables**:
- SVG renderer (svg.js)
- Grid system for layout
- Connection visualization
- Basic module rendering

**Verification Steps**:
1. Render a simple primitive with correct symbol and ports
2. Verify grid layout with proper spacing
3. Render connections between components
4. Display a simple module with internal components
5. Verify that components are positioned according to clock cycles

**Success Criteria**: A simple diagram can be rendered with primitives and modules correctly positioned on the grid, with connections properly drawn between components.

## Milestone 3: Advanced Component Features

**Objective**: Implement advanced component functionality for complex diagrams.

**Deliverables**:
- Port groups and arrangement algorithms
- Component loop processing
- Multi-bit signal support
- Parameter inheritance

**Verification Steps**:
1. Verify port grouping with different arrangement patterns
2. Test loop-generated components with iterator expressions
3. Validate multi-bit signals and indexed port references
4. Verify parameter inheritance from parent to child modules

**Success Criteria**: Components with complex port arrangements can be instantiated, component loops correctly generate repetitive structures, and parameters are properly inherited through the component hierarchy.

## Milestone 4: Layout and Navigation

**Objective**: Implement the full layout system and module navigation.

**Deliverables**:
- Complete automatic layout engine
- Module navigation with drill-down
- Compression mode toggling
- Clock cycle visualization

**Verification Steps**:
1. Verify that complex modules are laid out correctly
2. Test module drill-down and navigation back up
3. Toggle compression mode and verify layout changes
4. Validate clock cycle grid and timing visualization

**Success Criteria**: Users can navigate through a complex diagram, drilling down into modules and returning to parent modules, with proper layout in both compressed and full modes.

## Milestone 5: User Interface and Interactions

**Objective**: Complete the user interface with all interaction capabilities.

**Deliverables**:
- Zoom and pan controls
- Component inspection
- Complete navigation interface
- Visual styling and theme support

**Verification Steps**:
1. Test zooming and panning on complex diagrams
2. Verify component inspection with parameter display
3. Validate complete navigation workflow
4. Test visual customization from component definitions

**Success Criteria**: The full application provides a smooth user experience with intuitive navigation, inspection, and visualization of complex neural network diagrams.

## Milestone 6: Performance Optimization and Testing

**Objective**: Ensure the application performs well even with large, complex diagrams.

**Deliverables**:
- Performance optimizations
- Complete test suite
- Example diagram library
- User documentation

**Verification Steps**:
1. Test rendering performance with large diagrams
2. Validate memory usage during extended use
3. Run full test suite with high coverage
4. Verify documentation completeness with examples

**Success Criteria**: The application handles complex diagrams with good performance, passes all tests, and provides clear documentation for users.

## Verification Timeline

For each milestone, the verification process will follow these steps:

1. **Unit Testing**: Verify individual components work correctly
2. **Integration Testing**: Verify components work together
3. **Visual Testing**: Verify rendering is correct
4. **User Testing**: Verify user interactions work as expected
5. **Performance Testing**: Verify performance meets requirements
