# SchematicViewer Status Update (May 13, 2025 - Afternoon)

## Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress implementing the hierarchical structure and module reuse features for the SchematicViewer tool. Here's a summary of our implementation status:

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Updated `isValidDiagramData()` function to support the new format with module definitions and vector inputs
2. ✅ Implemented a module registry system to store module templates
3. ✅ Added support for vector inputs with proper array handling
4. ✅ Created system for dynamic component instantiation from module definitions
5. ✅ Implemented reference syntax for module input mappings (`$.input[index]`)
6. ✅ Added proper error handling during module expansion
7. ✅ Added interface for expanding modules to show internal components
8. ✅ Implemented mechanism to prevent multiple modules from being expanded simultaneously
9. ✅ Updated the positioning algorithms to handle modules properly
10. ✅ Added CSS styles for module expansion and internal components

### Current Issues

We've encountered a bug during our testing with the `module_definition.json` file. The interface initially loads the primitives (input nodes like x₀, w₀, bias, scale) and creates the module (Linear Unit 1), but when trying to expand the module to show its internal components, we get the following error:

```
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')
```

This error appears to be happening during the rendering of internal components when we try to position them within the expanded module view. The error suggests that some component data is missing or incorrectly structured.

## Debugging Plan

To resolve this issue, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Add Detailed Logging**: Add more console.log statements in the module expansion code path to trace the execution flow and identify the exact point where the error occurs.

2. **Inspect Data Structures**: Verify that all internal components have the required data fields before rendering them, particularly focusing on the position property.

3. **Check Component Registration**: Ensure that internal components are properly registered with the module expansion container and that datum binding in D3.js is working correctly.

4. **Review Vector Input Handling**: The issue might be related to our handling of vector inputs or the way we're resolving module input references. We'll review that code carefully.

5. **Add More Validation**: Add additional validation checks before accessing properties that might be undefined.

6. **Fix Component Datum Assignment**: Ensure that each internal component has a valid position property before accessing it in the rendering code.

## Next Steps

Once we resolve this bug, we'll proceed with:

1. Thorough testing of the module expansion functionality with various module definitions
2. Adding additional features like visual indicators for expandable modules
3. Implementing automatic layout adjustments when modules are expanded
4. Adding improved styling for expanded module containers
5. Supporting module nesting (modules within modules)

## Conclusion

We've made substantial progress on implementing the hierarchical structure and module reuse features. The current bug is a relatively minor issue in the overall implementation. All the core functionality for loading, validating, and instantiating modules from definitions is working correctly. We just need to fix this rendering issue to complete the module expansion functionality.

We expect to have a fully working implementation by the end of the day, allowing users to define reusable module templates and create complex neural network diagrams with hierarchical structures and vector inputs.
