# SchematicViewer Diagram Format

This document explains the JSON netlist format used in the SchematicViewer tool to define neural network diagrams.

## Overview

The diagram is defined in a JSON file with two main sections:
- `nodes`: The components in the neural network (inputs, operations, outputs)
- `connections`: The edges that connect these components

## Node Format

Each node represents a component in the neural network and has the following properties:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "type": "component_type",
  "label": "display_text",
  "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200}
}
```

### Properties

| Property | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the node | Yes |
| `type` | The component type (see supported types below) | Yes |
| `label` | Text to display on the node (defaults to type if not provided) | No |
| `position` | X/Y coordinates for positioning the node on the canvas | Yes |

### Node Ports

Each node type has specific input and output ports that serve as connection points:

| Node Type | Input Ports | Output Ports |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `input` | None | `out` (right side) |
| `output` | `in` (left side) | None |
| `add` | `in1` (upper left), `in2` (lower left) | `out` (right side) |
| `mul` | `in1` (upper left), `in2` (lower left) | `out` (right side) |
| `relu2` | `in` (left side) | `out` (right side) |
| `clamp` | `in` (left side) | `out` (right side) |

### Supported Node Types

The SchematicViewer supports these component types:

| Type | Description | Visual |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `input` | Input signal (e.g., x0, w0, bias) | Light blue rectangle |
| `output` | Final output value (e.g., y) | Light green rectangle |
| `add` | Addition block with two inputs | White square |
| `mul` | Multiplication block with two inputs | White square |
| `relu2` | Square of ReLU activation | Yellow square |
| `clamp` | Range limiter | Light red square |

## Connection Format

Connections represent the edges between nodes and define how data flows through the network:

```json
{
  "source": "source_node_id",
  "target": "target_node_id",
  "sourcePort": "output_port_name",
  "targetPort": "input_port_name"
}
```

### Properties

| Property | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `source` | ID of the source node | Yes |
| `target` | ID of the target node | Yes |
| `sourcePort` | Name of the output port on the source node (defaults to "out") | No |
| `targetPort` | Name of the input port on the target node (defaults to "in") | No |

### Port Connections

The `sourcePort` and `targetPort` properties specify which ports to connect between nodes. If these are omitted, the default output port ("out") of the source node will connect to the default input port ("in") of the target node.

For nodes with multiple input ports (like `add` and `mul`), it's recommended to explicitly specify the `targetPort` as either "in1" or "in2" to ensure the connection attaches to the correct input.

## Example Diagram

The sample `diagram.json` represents a simple neural network component that performs:
1. Multiplication of an input value (`x0`) with a weight (`w0`)
2. Addition of a bias term
3. Application of ReLUÂ² activation
4. Clamping to limit the range
5. Final output (`y`)

This reflects a common pattern in neural networks: weighted input + bias, followed by activation and normalization.

### Visual Representation

```
   x0        w0

    v        v
    +--------+
    |   mul1  |
    +--------+
         |     bias
         v      |

    |  add1  |<-+

    | clamp1 |
    +--------+
         |
         v
         y
```

## Creating Custom Diagrams

To create your own custom neural network diagrams:

1. Follow the node and connection format described above
2. Position nodes in a visually clear arrangement
3. Ensure each node has a unique ID
4. Make sure connections reference valid node IDs
5. Save the file with a `.json` extension
6. Load it in the SchematicViewer

## Loading Diagrams

There are two ways to load diagram JSON files into the viewer:

1. **File Input**: Click the "File Options" button in the header and use the file input to select a JSON file
2. **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag a diagram JSON file from your file explorer and drop it anywhere on the diagram area

## Future Enhancements

In future versions, the diagram format will be extended to support:
- Node grouping into macros/subcircuits
- Additional node metadata
- Custom visual styling options
- Multiple diagram layers
